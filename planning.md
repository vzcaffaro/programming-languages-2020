**Midterm:** Everybody got one extra point on the midterm (but cutting off at 10 points). The reason is that the smallest unit of points awarded was 0.5 and this seemed a bit coarse on a grade of 10. With this adjustment I feel that the grades give a fair account.


**Midterm 2:** I decided to cancel Midterm 2. We are spending more time than planned on Haskell and lambda calculus etc, but I think it is worth it: 

- I think you understand better how an interpreter works this semester than students did last semester. This will pay off next semester in Compiler Construction. 

- You got much more proficient at Haskell as compared to students last semester.

- We also need time to do Assignment 3. (Last year we did not have what was the first assignment this year.) I will add the 9 points of Midterm 2 to Assignment 3. I think that is fair as this assignment probably takes more time than Assignment 2 (let me know).

- Assignment 3 is important because it will show that all we learned so far also applies to imperative programming languages. It will make clear (I hope) that in a certain sense functional programming is easier than imperative programming. Or, from another point of view, that it is possible and natural to combine functional and imperative programming in one and the same language.

**Final Exam:** I designed the outlines of the final. It will be a take-home over 3 days. I am planning to run it Tue-Thu in the final's week, but let me know if there are reasons to move it. The final will consists of (subject to change)

- 10 points worth of questions taken from the homework on lambda calculus and rewriting.
- two problem solving tasks each worth 10 points on the topic of rewriting/algorithms.
- one of the two will be a rewrite system where I won't tell you what it computes; you have to find out by analysing it.
- the other will be an algorithm to be implemented by a rewrite system (a bit like merge sort).

As I see it now, there will be no programming in the final, no Haskell or LambaNat programming required. But I may ask you to evaluate a LambdaNat program pen-and-paper.

This time, Hoare logic will not be part of the final.

**Lessons from the midterm/studyguide for the final:** I recommend to carefully revise the midterm as this material will be highly relevant also in the final. I recommend at least the following:

- To revise confluence, etc I added more questions to this homework:

- To revise parsing lambda terms (see also the video) I added more questions to this homework:

- To revise reducing lambda expressions (see also the video):

I will run through the answers for the midterm on the Thursday after Thanksgiving. So it would be great to prepare any questions you might have.
