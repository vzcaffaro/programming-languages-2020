## Assignments

(see also [assessment](assessment.md))

Here are the basic rules for assignments, let me know if there are any questions:

- You can work on the assignments in groups of two students.
- Each group makes a **private github** repository which is used for **all** assignments submitted by the group. Create subfolders of the repo such as `Assignment1`, etc (as appropriate).
- Sharing code for assignments is **plagiarism**. So be careful that your repo is private.
- All students of the group as well as myself should be collaborators on the group repo.
- If you are stuck on your work, commit and push what you have to git and ask me a question. I can then inspect your code on git and give you quick feedback.
- Make good use of git. Commit and push regularly. Typically, **you would commit and push after having implemented and tested a new function**. You need to create a trail of your work. It is not enough to only submit complete solutions. I need to be able to see the progress you are making over time. **There will be at least a 10% penalty for not respecting these instructions**. 
- As git has version control, do not create different files/folders for the different versions of the same source code file. One can always go back and look at the history to access previous versions. Use meaningful commit-messages that help to navigate the history. 
- To collaborate on the same file, consider using branches (eg one for each student). Do not make copies of the same file: Branches allow collaborators to work on the same file independently. Branches can then be merged later again. 
- Do not commit machine generated files. Consider using a [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

Anything unclear? Any questions? Let me know ...
