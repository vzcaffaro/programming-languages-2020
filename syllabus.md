## Course Description 

**The aim of the course** is to have a look under the hood of programming languages. How do programming languages work? Could you design your own programming language? Instead of looking at particular examples of programming languages, we will build our own. It will be a small language and the implementation will not be efficient, but we will be able to understand in all detail how it works. 

Next semester, in Compiler Construction, we will demonstrate that the principles we learn this semester also apply to industrial scale programming languages such as C++. 

**Prerequisites:** (MATH 250, CPSC 350) I assume that you know at least one, ideally a few more, programming languages. It would also be good to have learned something about computer architecture. One theme of the course is how to bridge the gap between a programming language and the actual machine, so some awareness of how actual machines work is needed to fully appreciate the material. Finally, while I will introduce the mathematics that we need to engineer our programming languages, some ability in manipulating formal mathematical models as typically acquired in a discrete mathematics or introductory logic course will be needed.

You must score a 70 or above to receive a P when taking the course P/NP.

## Late Policy
If you need more time for an assignment that may be possible if
- you can prove to me that you already have done serious work on the assignment (for example by showing me the code in your GitHub repository);
- you can explain the special circumstances that make you think that you should get more time for the assignment than the other students.

## Participation

- It is expected that students attend every lecture and participate in the [Discussion Forum](discussion-forum.md). 
- I also appreciate if students make use of the office hours, which gives me valuable feedback on how the class is going.
- Participation will contribute 5% to the final course grade, see [Assessment](assessment.md).
