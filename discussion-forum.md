## Discussion Forum

For a more collaborative learning experience, I want to reward participation in asking, discussing and answering questions on this [google group](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/programming-languages-chapman-2020) with up to 5% of the total points, see [Assessment](assessment.md) for details. 

As I want this forum to be a space for collaborative learning, I will grade participation, not the correctness of answers.

**I will assume that you follow the discussions. I will accept no excuses if you missed material or announcements because you didn't. I expect that you set the settings to receive "All email".**

I manage the settings of the group so that only members have the right to post and read. Members are students who take the class and myself.

If you didn't get an invitation, send me an email.

PS The reason to choose google groups is that it integrates seemlessly into my email. I receive your posts in my inbox and can react to them by replying via email. Indeed, my main channel of communication is email. I try to watch other channels such as slack, zulip, twitter, facebook, phone, text, whatsapp, etc but I usually do not carry a phone with me which makes the combination of laptop/email my favourite way of communication.
